# KMTTG Plus

Kevin Moye's Tivo To Go (plus tools)

## Summary

The goals of this project are:
- Port the original kmttg Java source code to Go, using modern designs and best practices
- Add a new GraphQL API
- Redesign, enhance, and implement the WebUI in React, and expose the full feature set of the original native UI
- Containerize the new full-stack application in Docker, along with all the tools that are used to perform the existing download and transcoding features, to allow easy deployment to other platforms

My main purpose for doing this is to learn new skills, and keep my current skills sharp. I would like to run this 24/7 on my Synology NAS, and enable the same on other platforms by using Docker; and additionally be able to extend the existing feature set.

## Credits

> You stood on the shoulders of geniuses to accomplish something as fast as you could, and before you even knew what you had, you patented it, and packaged it, and slapped it on a plastic lunchbox.

Most credit goes to Kevin Moye, the original developer of KMTTG, which was a tool that I use all the time. His hard work gave Tivo users a path forward to preserving their recordings. Additional credit to other developers that took up the mantle when Kevin retired.
